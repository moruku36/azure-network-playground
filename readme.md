# azure network playground

This repository stores Azure Bicep files that create an environment for checking the log output of Azure's network-based services.
The connection monitor is used to make HTTP accesses run periodically, making it easier to check network logs.
Diagnostic settings is also done in bicep, and logs are aggregated in a single Log Analytics workspace created in bicep.
